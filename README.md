**The chart found an edge. We asked whether chance could draw it too.**

You've seen lots of them: a so-called “alpha” strategy and an equity curve that claims to beat the market. They explain the setup, promise there is no future leak, and show that it earns money.

**Most “technical” indicators are essentially astrology with better charts.**

 AlphaVerify is built to put an end to all that bullshit.

The figures below are historical results from the former selection-first pipeline; they have not been regenerated with validation of all bins. Their original percentage-point score axes are historical; current shifts store `conditional_probability - baseline_probability`, and current scores are one hundredth of the former scale. A shift of 0.233 displays as 23.3%, the same 23.3-percentage-point difference.

## Example - MA Cross 50/200

The "MA Cross" heatmap looks decisive: the classic MA Cross 50/200 produces a coherent **23.3 percentage-point** upside/downside contrast.

</p>

Then the same full-grid score is applied to 10,000 fitted synthetic histories, and it turns out the **decisive edge** is just pure luck.

## Try it

Run commands from the repository root. 

The distribution, CLI, and Python package are named `alphaverify`.
The repository name remains `alpha-verify`. Reinstall the editable package
after updating an existing checkout.

```
python -m pip install -e .

alphaverify measure
alphaverify compare
alphaverify validate
alphaverify select
```

Each pipeline command also accepts `--cuda` when a CUDA-capable PyTorch installation and device are available.

## How it works

| Stage | CLI Command | What it does | Mathematical form |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | measure | Measure conditional probabilities | `π_condition(r, δ, k, t)` |
| 2 | compare | Compare them with the baseline | `G = π_condition − π_baseline` |
| 3 | validate | Validate every supported bin against the null | `p̂_k < 0.05 or p̂_k ≥ 0.05` |
| 4 | select | Retain cleared bins and render their shift heatmaps | `K_selected = {k : p̂_k < 0.05}` |


Validation writes `03_validation/`; selection consumes only a current validation result and writes `04_selection/`. Every cleared bin is retained—there is no top-k ranking or secondary economic gate.

- [Test contracts](tests/README.md) — what the fast suite protects and what requires a real pipeline run.
- [Workspaces](workspaces/README.md) — experiment declarations, plugins, generated artifacts, and safe workspace changes.
